# Product Requirements Document: Pomodoro Desktop App

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a lightweight, persistent Pomodoro timer application for desktop. The primary goal is to enhance user productivity by providing a simple, customizable, and visually distinct timer for focused work sessions and breaks. The application is designed to be unobtrusive yet always accessible, catering to users who need a dedicated tool to manage their focus without the complexity of a full task-management suite.

## 2. Goals

*   To provide a simple and effective tool for implementing the Pomodoro Technique.
*   To offer users full control over work and break session durations.
*   To ensure the timer is always visible and easily accessible without being distracting.
*   To deliver clear, at-a-glance status updates through dynamic color changes.
*   To provide distinct audio cues for session transitions.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As a student,** I want to customize the length of my focus and break timers so that I can match my study sessions to my energy levels and the complexity of my tasks.
*   **As a student,** I want the application to stay on top of my other windows so that I can always see the remaining time without switching contexts.
*   **As a student,** I want to receive a clear sound notification when it's time to switch between studying and resting so that I don't have to constantly check the clock.
*   **As a student,** I want the app's color to change between work and break periods so I can immediately know which mode I'm in just by looking at my screen.
*   **As a student,** I want to be able to shrink the app to a minimal size so that it doesn't take up valuable screen space while I'm working.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  **Customizable Timers:**
    *   The user must be able to set a custom duration (in minutes) for the "Work" timer.
    *   The user must be able to set a custom duration (in minutes) for the "Break" timer.
    *   The application must provide pre-defined presets for common Pomodoro timings (e.g., 25/5, 50/10).
2.  **Timer Controls:**
    *   The user must be able to start, pause, and reset the timer.
3.  **Audio Alerts:**
    *   The application must play a distinct sound when a work session ends and a break session begins.
    *   The application must play a distinct sound when a break session ends and a work session begins.
4.  **Window Management:**
    *   The application must have an "always on top" mode that the user can enable or disable.
    *   The application window must be resizable, down to a minimal, compact view that only displays the essential timer information.
5.  **Visual Feedback:**
    *   The application's UI theme must change color to visually differentiate between "Work" and "Break" periods.
6.  **Application State:**
    *   The application must ask for user confirmation before closing if a timer is currently running.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   Detailed task management or to-do list functionality.
*   Historical analytics, productivity reports, or timer logs.
*   User accounts and cross-device data synchronization.
*   Customizable sound library or user-uploaded audio files.

## 6. Design Considerations

*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Work Session:** The UI should use a soft pink color scheme.
    *   **Rest Session:** The UI should use a light blue color scheme.
*   **Minimal View:** The compact view should be thoughtfully designed to remain legible and functional, showing only the timer digits (e.g., MM:SS).
*   **UI:** The user interface should be clean, modern, and aesthetically pleasing.

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   This is a desktop application and should be developed with a framework suitable for cross-platform support if possible.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   As this application is intended for personal use, formal success metrics like user retention or daily active users are not required. Success will be determined by the application's ability to meet the functional and design requirements outlined in this document.

## 9. Open Questions

*   None at this time.
